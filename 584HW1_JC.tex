\begin{solution}
	Let $i\leq n$ be defined such that $|x_i-y_i| \geq |x_m-y_m|$ for all $m\leq n$. By definition, $|x_i-y_i| = d_\infty(x,y)$. Notice that $$|x_i-y_i| \leq |x_1-y_1| + \dotsc + |x_i-y_i|+ \dotsc + |x_n-y_n|\leq n|x_i-y_i|.$$ Thus, $$|x_i-y_i|^p \leq |x_1-y_1|^p + \dotsc + |x_i-y_i|^p+ \dotsc + |x_n-y_n|^p\leq n|x_i-y_i|^p.$$ By taking the each expression in the inequality to the $1/p$ power, we get $$(|x_i-y_i|^p)^{\frac{1}{p}} \leq (|x_1-y_1|^p + \dotsc + |x_i-y_i|^p+ \dotsc +|x_n-y_n|^p)^{\frac{1}{p}} \leq (n|x_i-y_i|^p)^{\frac{1}{p}},$$ and $$|x_i-y_i| \leq d_p(x,y) \leq n^\frac{1}{p}|x_i-y_i|.$$ Taking the limit as p approaches infinity gives $$\lim_{p\to\infty}|x_i-y_i| \leq \lim_{p\to\infty}d_p(x,y) \leq \lim_{p\to\infty}n^\frac{1}{p}|x_i-y_i|.$$ Thus, $$d_\infty(x,y) \leq \lim_{p\to\infty}d_p(x,y) \leq d_\infty(x,y).$$ Therefore, by the Squeeze Theorem,
	\[
	\lim_{p\to\infty} d_p(x,y) = d_\infty(x,y).
	\]

		\[
			x\cdot y \leq \frac{|x|_p^p}{p} + \frac{|y|_q^q}{q}.
